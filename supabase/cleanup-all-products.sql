-- =====================================================
-- Complete Products & Media Cleanup Script
-- =====================================================
-- This script will completely reset all product-related data
-- WARNING: This will permanently delete all products and related data!

-- Disable foreign key checks temporarily (if needed)
-- SET session_replication_role = replica;

-- =====================================================
-- Step 1: Clean up related tables (in dependency order)
-- =====================================================

-- Clean up cart items first
DELETE FROM cart_items WHERE product_id IN (SELECT id FROM products);
SELECT 'Cleaned cart_items table' as status;

-- Clean up order items
DELETE FROM order_items WHERE product_id IN (SELECT id FROM products);
SELECT 'Cleaned order_items table' as status;

-- Clean up product reviews
DELETE FROM product_reviews WHERE product_id IN (SELECT id FROM products);
SELECT 'Cleaned product_reviews table' as status;

-- Clean up product media
DELETE FROM product_media WHERE product_id IN (SELECT id FROM products);
SELECT 'Cleaned product_media table' as status;

-- Clean up product variants
DELETE FROM product_variants WHERE product_id IN (SELECT id FROM products);
SELECT 'Cleaned product_variants table' as status;

-- Clean up product collection items
DELETE FROM product_collection_items WHERE product_id IN (SELECT id FROM products);
SELECT 'Cleaned product_collection_items table' as status;

-- Clean up product tag items
DELETE FROM product_tag_items WHERE product_id IN (SELECT id FROM products);
SELECT 'Cleaned product_tag_items table' as status;

-- Clean up media files (orphaned files)
DELETE FROM media_files WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT media_id FROM product_media WHERE media_id IS NOT NULL
);
SELECT 'Cleaned orphaned media_files' as status;

-- =====================================================
-- Step 2: Clean up main products table
-- =====================================================

-- Get count before deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) as products_before_deletion FROM products;

-- Delete all products
DELETE FROM products;

-- Verify deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) as products_after_deletion FROM products;
SELECT 'All products deleted successfully!' as status;

-- =====================================================
-- Step 3: Clean up collections and tags (optional)
-- =====================================================

-- Clean up empty product collections
DELETE FROM product_collections WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT collection_id FROM product_collection_items WHERE collection_id IS NOT NULL
);
SELECT 'Cleaned empty product_collections' as status;

-- Clean up unused product tags
DELETE FROM product_tags WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT tag_id FROM product_tag_items WHERE tag_id IS NOT NULL
);
SELECT 'Cleaned unused product_tags' as status;

-- =====================================================
-- Step 4: Reset any sequences (if applicable)
-- =====================================================

-- Note: Since we're using UUIDs, there are no sequences to reset
-- But if you had any auto-incrementing columns, you would reset them here:
-- ALTER SEQUENCE products_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

SELECT 'Sequences reset (UUID-based tables don''t need this)' as status;

-- =====================================================
-- Step 5: Verification
-- =====================================================

-- Count remaining records in all product-related tables
SELECT 
  'products' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM products

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'product_media' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM product_media

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'cart_items' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM cart_items

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'order_items' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM order_items

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'product_reviews' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM product_reviews

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'media_files' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM media_files

ORDER BY table_name;

-- =====================================================
-- Step 6: Re-enable foreign key checks
-- =====================================================

-- SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

-- =====================================================
-- Completion Message
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
  'ðŸŽ‰ Complete products cleanup finished!' as status,
  'All products and related data have been permanently deleted.' as message,
  'Storage files need to be cleaned separately via the cleanup script.' as note;
