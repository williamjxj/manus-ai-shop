/*
BUCKET CONFIGURATION:
‚úÖ Bucket Name: product-images
‚úÖ Public Access: Enabled (for viewing images)
‚úÖ File Size Limit: 10MB
‚úÖ Allowed Types: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

SECURITY POLICIES:
‚úÖ Public can view all product images
‚úÖ Authenticated users can upload images
‚úÖ Users can only update/delete their own uploads
‚úÖ Folder-based organization by user ID

UPLOAD PATH STRUCTURE:
- products/{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}
- Example: products/1703123456789-abc123.jpg

API USAGE:
// Upload file
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('product-images')
  .upload('products/filename.jpg', file)

// Get public URL
const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
  .from('product-images')
  .getPublicUrl('products/filename.jpg')

IMPORTANT:
- Images are publicly accessible once uploaded
- File names should be unique to avoid conflicts
- Consider image optimization before upload
- Monitor storage usage and costs
