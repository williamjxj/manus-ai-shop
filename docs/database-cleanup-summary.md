## 🎯 media_files Table Analysis

### When media_files Gets Data:

The `media_files` table was designed to store metadata when using the `adult-media-utils.ts` utility, specifically:

1. **When called**: Via `uploadAdultContentToStorage()` function
2. **Data stored**: File metadata including content hash, dimensions, moderation status
3. **Purpose**: Advanced adult content management with deduplication
4. **Current status**: **UNUSED** - the utility exists but is never imported or used

### Current Media System:

- **Active system**: `product_media` table
- **Used by**: Current upload system in `/upload` page
- **Relationship**: One-to-many with products
- **Features**: Multiple images/videos per product, primary media selection

## 🛠️ Cleanup Actions Completed

### ✅ Files Cleaned:

- Removed unused `adult-media-utils.ts` (legacy)
- Removed old upload page (replaced)

### 🗄️ Database Cleanup Available:

- SQL script generated: `supabase/cleanup-unused-tables-final.sql`
- **8 unused tables** identified for removal
- **0 records** in unused tables (safe to remove)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Complete Database Cleanup:

1. **Backup database** (recommended)
2. **Run SQL script** in Supabase Dashboard:
   ```
   supabase/cleanup-unused-tables-final.sql
   ```
3. **Verify application** works after cleanup

### Benefits After Cleanup:

- **Cleaner database schema** with only used tables
- **Reduced complexity** in migrations and backups
- **Better performance** with fewer unused indexes
- **Clearer codebase** without legacy files

## 📊 Summary Statistics

- **Tables analyzed**: 21 total
- **Tables in use**: 13 (keep)
- **Tables unused**: 8 (remove)
- **Files removed**: 2 legacy files
- **Current data**: Only 6 records in profiles table (all others clean)

## ✨ Result

After cleanup, you'll have a **clean, optimized database** with only the tables actually used by your application, and a **cleaner codebase** without legacy files.
